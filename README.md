## Notes

* If you have a lot of playlists to manage, apparently this theme is not for you. For me, I am just playing with one auto playlist.
* Some features of components are disabled by default in the theme, eg. _Desktop lyric_. You may need to turn it on by yourself manually.
* Biography cache files are stored in **C:\muzik\cache** by default. If you want to change the location, open **profile\user-scripts\yttm\biography.ini**, find and replace current location with yours.
* This theme is supported in foobar2000 32-bit version only for now.
